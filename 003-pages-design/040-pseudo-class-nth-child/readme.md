---
We can use a CSS pseudo-class to also target a certain element on a page based upon its position on the page. For instance, if we want to select the first item, or the last item, or some specific number in a list of items we can do so by using the CSS nth child pseudo-class. There are several different CSS properties related to the nth child.
